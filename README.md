## About Repository
This repository contains the **Machine Learning** projects.

## Projects
1) House Price Prediction
    - It's a simple **House Price Prediction** system built on **Regression** models. I have used three different **Regression** models **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regression**, and **Random Forest Regression, to predict house prices in California.

2) MNIST Digits Handwritten
   - Models used: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier, RandomForestClassifier, OneVsOneClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier.

3) Mine Detection
    - It's a simple **Logistic Regression** model. It's used to predict whether it's a rock or mine based on the given data.
